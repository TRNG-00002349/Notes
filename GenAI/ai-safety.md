# Responsible Use of AI Tools

## Understanding What AI Actually Is

AI language models generate text through statistical next token prediction—they calculate which words are most likely to follow based on patterns in training data. They don't understand meaning, possess knowledge, or reason about truth. They produce fluent, convincing text that *looks* like understanding, but it's pattern matching, not comprehension. The model has no concept of whether its output is accurate, logical, or even coherent beyond surface-level plausibility. This fundamental limitation underpins every responsible use consideration.

## Verification is Non-Negotiable

**Never trust AI outputs without verification**, especially for:
- Facts, statistics, dates, quotes
- Medical, legal, or financial advice
- Technical specifications or code that will be deployed
- Citations and references (models frequently fabricate sources)
- Scientific or historical claims

Cross-reference critical information with authoritative sources. Treat AI output as a draft that requires human review.

## Recognize Hallucinations

AI will confidently generate false information when it lacks data or context. Warning signs:
- Overly specific details (exact dates, numbers, names)
- Citations that sound plausible but are unverifiable
- Consistent tone even when uncertain
- Fabricated technical details or references

**The model cannot tell you when it's hallucinating.** Confidence level in the output means nothing.

## Bias and Fairness

AI models inherit biases from training data:
- Demographic biases (race, gender, age, culture)
- Geographical and linguistic bias (overrepresents English, Western perspectives)
- Temporal bias (training data cutoff dates)
- Selection bias (internet text doesn't represent all human knowledge)

Be especially cautious when using AI for decisions affecting people: hiring, loan approvals, medical triage, criminal justice, educational assessment.

## Privacy and Data Security

**Don't input sensitive information:**
- Personal identification (SSN, passport numbers, addresses)
- Proprietary business data or trade secrets
- Patient/client confidential information
- Passwords, API keys, credentials
- Anything subject to GDPR, HIPAA, or compliance requirements

Assume that data you input may be stored, logged, or used for training. Read terms of service carefully.

## Academic and Professional Integrity

**Plagiarism and misrepresentation:**
- Don't pass off AI-generated content as your own work
- Cite AI use when required by your institution or employer
- Understand your organization's AI use policies
- In academic settings, check with instructors before using AI

AI can assist with brainstorming, outlining, and editing—but the work and understanding must be yours.

## Appropriate Use Cases

**Good uses:**
- Brainstorming and ideation
- First drafts and outlines
- Code scaffolding and debugging assistance
- Explaining concepts in different ways
- Summarizing content you already have
- Translation assistance
- Formatting and restructuring text

**Poor uses:**
- Final source of truth for important decisions
- Replacement for domain expertise
- Legal or medical advice
- Security-critical code without review
- Generating content at scale for SEO or spam
- Automated decision-making without human oversight

## Environmental and Societal Impact

Training and running large AI models has environmental costs (energy consumption, carbon footprint). Consider whether AI is necessary for your task or if simpler tools would suffice.

Be aware of labor and economic impacts: content creators, writers, artists, and knowledge workers face displacement. Use AI in ways that complement rather than exploit human labor.

## When Not to Use AI

- High-stakes decisions (medical diagnosis, legal judgment, financial advice)
- Situations requiring empathy and human connection
- When accuracy is critical and unverifiable
- Tasks you need to understand deeply yourself
- Where use violates policy, ethics, or law
- When traditional tools are more appropriate

## Bottom Line

AI tools are assistive technologies with significant limitations. They require informed, critical users who verify outputs, understand biases, and take responsibility for how they're deployed. Your judgment, expertise, and ethics cannot be delegated to a statistical model.
