# QC Questions on SQL

- What is a relational database?
 - Name some common RDBMS platforms/vendors
 - What is SQL?
   - SQL is a standard developed by Oracle to define how relational database systems should be implmented.
   - Different implementations include PostGres, Maria, Oracle, MySQL, MS-SQL (T-SQL), SQLite
   - Structured Query Language, commonly used with relational databases to manipulate the database, inserting deleting, modifying schema, controlling access
   - is a declarative language (and is missing procedural components without additional features)
 - What are the sub-languages of SQL?
 - What keywords are associated with DML?
   - data manipulation language - insert, delete, update - how we maniopulate data (not schema, not querying)
 - What keywords are associated with DDL?
   - data definition language - create table, create index -how we define schema
 - What keywords are associated with DCL?
   - Data control language - GRANT, REVOKE - set permissions and control users
 - What keywords are associated with TCL?
   - Transaction Control Language - COMMIT, SAVEPOINT, ROLLBACK, BEGIN - this is how we define "units of work" to be committed atomically as a transaction
 - What keywords are associated with DQL?
   - Data Query Language - SELECT, WHERE, HAVING, JOIN - this is querying data from the tables into result sets
 - What is a result set?
 - What is normalization?
   - guiding advice you can use when designing your schema.
   - there are a handful of forms, where most folks only really care about maybe 3-4 of these.
   - 1: primary key and atomicity
   - 2: if you have a composite key, we don't want information in any rows to rely on part of that key
   - 3: we don;t want transitive dependencies
 - What are the normal forms, and to what level do we usually comply to?
 - What is multiplicity?
   - one-to-many, one-to-one, many-to-many, and will require a junction table
 - What is a primary key?
 - What is a natural key?
 - What is surrogate key?
 - What is a composite key?
 - super key
 - candiate key
 - What is a foreign key?
 - What is referential integrity?
 - What is the difference between a scalar and an aggregate function?
 - What is a subquery?

 - Under what circumstances can two result sets be unioned?
 - What sorts of joins exist in SQL?
 - What is a transaction?
 - What are the properties of a transaction?
 - What are the transaction isolation levels?
 - What is a dirty-read? What isolation level(s) resolve this phenonmenon?
 - What is a phantom-read? What isolation level(s) resolve this phenonmenon?
 - What is a non-repeatable read? What isolation level(s) resolve this phenonmenon?
 - Is SQL considered a procedural, declarative, or functional language?
 - How can you select all of the entries in a table (ex: Users) including all columns?
 - What is a WHERE clause used for?
 - How can you sort the entries in your result set by a particular column?
 - What is the purpose of the GROUP BY clause?
 - What are some examples of scalar functions?
 - What are some examples of aggregate functions?
 - What is a self-join? Provide an example of when you might use one
 - What is JDBC?
 - What are the core classes and interfaces found in the JDBC API?
 - Explain how you would connect your Java application to a database using JDBC.
 - What is the difference between a Statement and PreparedStatement?
 - Are DML statements in JDBC automatically committed? Is this a problem?
 - When would you use a CallableStatement?
 - What is SQL injection?
 - Why is it recommended to use a PreparedStatement over a Statement?
