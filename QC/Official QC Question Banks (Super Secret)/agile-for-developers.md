## Required Questions

[Back to top](#unit)

* What are the steps in the software development lifecycle?
  * Keywords, concepts, or topics that should be in the response:
    * In order: Planning / Requirements gathering, Analysis, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance
  * Possible follow-up questions
    * What would come after/before step [X]?
    * Can you think of what you would need to do before/after [X]?

* What is the difference between Waterfall and Agile methodologies? Explain the benefits and drawbacks of each
  * Keywords, concepts, or topics that should be in the response:
    * Waterfall: linear, one-way, unable to make changes; best for projects with fixed, rigid requirements or highly regulated
    * Agile: iterative approach, customer collaboration, responding to change; best for projects in dynamic environments where adaptation required
  * Possible follow-up questions
    * If you need to adapt quickly to changing requirements, which methodology is better suited for that?
    * Is there a situation when you would want to use waterfall instead of Agile?

* What are the benefits of an Agile development process?
  * Keywords, concepts, or topics that should be in the response:
    * Rapid development - Early deliverables (MVP)
    * Increased adaptability - Quick itteration
    * Higher Quality - Test integration
    * Continuous Improvement - Constant updating and developing
    * Collaboration and Visibility - Visable and available project tracking
    * Customer acceptance - Iterative development focuses on customer satisfaction

* What is the Scrum process?
  * Keywords, concepts, or topics that should be in the response:
    * Deliver value quickly, with continued development
    * Scrum breaks down complex work into smaller, manageable sections (sprints).
    * Scrum focuses on collaboration and communication, with regular review and introspection of the process.
    * Roles and responsibilities:
      * Product Owner - voice of the customer/client
      * Scrum Master - meeting facilitator

  * Keywords, concepts, or topics that should be in the response:
    * XP (Extreme programming) - paired programming, code reviews
    * Scrum - sprints, daily standups, story pointing
    * Kanban - kanban board
  * Possible follow-up questions
    * How is Scrum and Kanban different?
    * Can you give an example of Kanban board categories?
      * Board that has multiple columns as categories for the state of user stories
      * Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Done are typical categories

* Describe the Scrum ceremonies
  * Keywords, concepts, or topics that should be in the response:
    * Sprint planning meeting
    * Daily scrum (standups)
    * Sprint review
    * Sprint retrospective
  * Possible follow-up questions
    * How long is a typical sprint?
      * 2-4 weeks
    * What happens in the daily scrum standups?
      * Short, ~15 min total; update on the status of everyone's work
      * What you worked on yesterday, what you plan to work on today, and any blockers you have
    * What is the purpose of the sprint retrospective?
      * Think about improvements to the development process to change next sprint

* What is a "user story"?
  * Keywords, concepts, or topics that should be in the response:
    * Format: "As a [user], I can [action] so that [result]"
    * Short description of a feature to be implemented
  * Possible follow-up questions
    * How does story pointing work?

## Stretch Questions

[Back to top](#unit)

* What are the 3 pillars of Scrum?
  * Keywords, concepts, or topics that should be in the response:
    * Transparency - everyone understands the status of the project because of frequent progress updates
    * Inspection - the work is analyzed at the end of every sprint, and these reviews help keep the project on track.
    * Adaptation - each sprint offers a chance to adjust the product to make sure it meets the customer’s needs

* What is the role of a "Scrum master" in a project? What about the "Product owner"?
  * Keywords, concepts, or topics that should be in the response:
    * Scrum master is like the cheerleader / advocate for the team; they make sure nothing is in the team's way
    * Product owner sets the vision for the product, helps with generating requirements / user stories and prioritizing

* Explain the following metrics/charts: sprint velocity, burndown chart
  * Keywords, concepts, or topics that should be in the response:
    * Velocity - average story points completed per sprint
    * Burndown chart - showing reduction in outstanding story points over the sprint
  * Possible follow-up questions
    * Name some technologies teams can use to keep track of progress on different projects, tasks, and due dates.
      * JIRA, Github projects, Trello, Asana

* What is the "Definition of Done"?
  * Keywords, concepts, or topics that should be in the response:
    * The requirements the team agrees have to be met for a user story to be considered "done"
    * Example: all unit tests pass, code is reviewed and merged in feature branch, non-functional requirements met
  * Possible follow-up questions
    * How do you know if a user story is considered completed?

* List some of the principles declared in the Agile manifesto
  * Keywords, concepts, or topics that should be in the response:
    * Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
    * Welcome changing requirements
    * Preference for shorter timescale for releases
    * Business people & developers work together
    * Value face to face conversation for communication
    * Working software is the primary measure of progress
    * Sustainable development - should be able to maintain constant pace
    * Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
    * Simplicity – the art of maximizing the amount of work not done – is essential.
    * The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
    * At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
  * Possible follow-up questions
    * What do you mean? Can you explain some of the terms you mentioned?
